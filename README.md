# IdentityServerJwtService
Base identityserver, which will evolve over the time. 
Base items which will allows you to up and runnig for the idenityserver. 
Only for snippet or boilerplate, i am not going to maintain this for long time as it is hard to cope up with new Idservers with so many changes.
